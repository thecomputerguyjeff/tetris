#Tetris!!!
This will be great.

model.Shape factory returns one of 7 model.Shapes randomly.
Grid has 10 columns and 40 legal rows, with 3 overflow rows.
Game ends as soon as one shape is inside overflow rows.
Algorythmically place each shape in grid, optimizing rules of tetris.
return count of total model.Shapes with the display of grid at the end.

Use factory patterns for model.Shapes
Use MVC patterns for overall.
OOP single responsibility patterns for your functions

Rochel Shira has the model.Shapes.








###example mock:
        CalculatorService calc = mock(CalculatorService.class);
        
        when(calc.add(any(),any())).thenReturn(7);
